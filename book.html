	Day 1:
		soooooooo, nothing really went the way i wanted haha. i was planning on making and positioning everything by myself by moving picture frames but things didnâ€™t work out because of transparent backgrounds and image size. bright side, i learned how to position background images. negative, transparent backgrounds suck, it's really fifty fifty when i try to find them. i also was overly ambitious but this will be a temporary filler i guess until i draw and arrange my own background page bc 2 divs will really not work out with all the plans i have.

	Day 2: 
		ok, so this week i booked a lab with ms josephs. she showed me the light and demonstrated how i can clip images, remove unwanted backgrounds and create a square to link my journal to. however, i sort of forgot so i'll be reviewing what we did the moment i have the time to. it was not generally a busy week with comp sci so i don't have much else to say. i will be using the invisible square to do some devious misdoings :D
